#Google stock price prediction using neural networks

This project demonstrates how to use neural networks to predict Google stock prices based on historical data.By using Python and Tensorflow.

## üîç **Project Overview**
In this project, we:
- Preprocessed historical stock price data from a CSV file.
- Built a dense neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trained the model to predict the closing price of Google stock based on previous features.
- Visualized the model's performance with actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## üìÇ **Dataset**

We used a historical stock price dataset for Google (`GOOG.csv`). This dataset contains:
- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Open**: Opening price of the stock.
- **High**: Highest price of the stock during the trading day.
- **Low**: Lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
- **Close**: Closing price of the stock.
- **Volume**: Number of shares traded.
